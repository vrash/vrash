### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Vrash (he/him). After serving as interim CTO at [Checkatrade](www.checkatrade.com) through December 2024, I now lead engineering for Checkatrade Labs - an exciting new chapter focused on driving innovation!  
We're building the trusted foundation for every home in the UK. And we're [hiring!](https://apply.checkatrade.com/vacancies/vacancy-search-results.aspx) 

Previously I've worked at [carwow], [Amazon], [Bankbazaar], [Oracle] and a few startups.

Talk to me [@vrashabh] or feel free to DM me on [LinkedIn]. I try and respond to most folks on Sunday nights.
